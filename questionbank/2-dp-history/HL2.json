However, as the Second World War began, US policy shifted to allow some aid to the Allies. The Neutrality Law of 1939 allowed the US to sell weapons on a cash-and-carry basis. In 1941, this became known as Lend-Lease. The US also traded destroyers to Great Britain in 1940 and later took over defense of the western Atlantic. In 1941, the US and Great Britain signed the Atlantic Charter. In Asia, as Japan expanded into China and Indochina, the US established partial, then total, trade embargoes.
